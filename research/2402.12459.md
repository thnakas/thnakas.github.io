## Abstract
The modified British Medical Research Council muscle grading system remains the primary method for assessing outcomes following surgical intervention despite its subjectivity and numerous inherent flaws. A new objective outcome measure of elbow function in patients with a brachial plexus injury is proposed. 11 patients with a reconstructed brachial plexus (nerve reconstruction) and 10 unimpaired control subjects were evaluated. A custom apparatus measuring elbow flexion torque was developed. The subjects were asked to match their elbow flexion torque to a predefined torque. Time taken to achieve this predefined elbow flexion torque (latency) and duration of steady torque output were used as outcome measures. Healthy individuals were better at maintaining and regulating elbow torque. The patients with a brachial plexus injury showed similar latency while increasing their elbow torque (normalized to maximum elbow torque) but lacked the ability to modulate the latency with demand as the healthy subjects. This novel measure provides objective information regarding the patient's ability to control elbow torque after nerve reconstruction.
