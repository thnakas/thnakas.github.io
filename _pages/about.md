<div align="justify">

I am a Theoretical Physicist, exploring <b>Modified Gravitational Theories</b>, <b>Extra-Dimensional Theories of Gravity</b> & investigating <b>Novel Hairy</b> (yup, this is a thing üôÉ) <b>Compact-Object Solutions</b> such as <b>Black-Hole Solutions</b> üï≥Ô∏è.<br><br>

My research involves <i>model building, mathematical formulations, and rigorous analysis of new frameworks</i> to expand upon Einstein's General Relativity.<br><br>

‚ö´ <b>Black-Hole Solutions</b>:
Within the realm of modified gravitational theories and extra dimensions, I specialize in studying compact-object solutions, with a particular focus on black-hole solutions. These cosmic enigmas not only serve as intriguing laboratories for testing alternative theories of gravity but also offer insights into the nature of spacetime singularities and event horizons.
