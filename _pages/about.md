Theoretical Physicist | Exploring Modified Gravitational Theories, Extra-Dimensional Theories of Gravity & Investigating Novel Hairy (yup, this is a thing üôÉ) Compact-Object Solutions such as Black-Hole Solutions üï≥Ô∏è

My research involves model building, mathematical formulations, and rigorous analysis of new frameworks to expand upon Einstein's General Relativity.

‚ö´ Black-Hole Solutions:
Within the realm of modified gravitational theories and extra dimensions, I specialize in studying compact-object solutions, with a particular focus on black-hole solutions. These cosmic enigmas not only serve as intriguing laboratories for testing alternative theories of gravity but also offer insights into the nature of spacetime singularities and event horizons.
