<blockquote> We consider higher-order derivative gauge field corrections that arise in the fundamental context of dimensional reduction of String Theory and Lovelock-inspired gravities and obtain an exact and asymptotically flat black-hole solution, in the presence of non-trivial dilaton configurations. Specifically, by considering the gravitational theory of Euler-Heisenberg non-linear electrodynamics coupled to a dilaton field with specific coupling functions, we perform an extensive analysis of the characteristics of the black hole, including its geodesics for massive particles, the energy conditions, thermodynamical and stability analysis. The inclusion of a dilaton scalar potential in the action can also give rise to asymptotically (A)dS spacetimes and an effective cosmological constant. Moreover, we find that the black hole can be thermodynamically favored when compared to the Gibbons-Maeda-Garfinkle-Horowitz-Strominger (GMGHS) black hole for those parameters of the model that lead to a larger black-hole horizon for the same mass. Finally, it is observed that the energy conditions of the obtained black hole are indeed satisfied, further validating the robustness of the solution within the theoretical framework, but also implying that this self-gravitating dilaton-non-linear-electrodynamics system constitutes another explicit example of bypassing modern versions of the no-hair theorem without any violation of the energy conditions. </blockquote>

<blockquote> In this work, we delve into the model of the shift symmetric and parity-preserving Beyond Horndeski theory in all its generality. We present an explicit algorithm to extract static and spherically symmetric black holes with primary scalar charge adhering to the conservation of the Noether current emanating from the shift symmetry. We show that when the functionals \(G_2\) and \(G_4\) of the theory are linearly dependent, analytic homogeneous black-hole solutions exist, which can become regular by virtue of the primary charge contribution. Such geometries can easily enjoy the preservation of the Weak Energy Conditions, elevating them into healthier compact objects than most hairy black holes in modified theories of gravity. Finally, we revisit the concept of disformal transformations as a solution-generating mechanism and discuss the case of generic \(G_2\) and \(G_4\) functionals. </blockquote>

<blockquote> We present explicit black holes endowed with primary scalar hair within the shift-symmetric subclass of Beyond Horndeski theories. These solutions depend, in addition to the conventional mass parameter, on a second free parameter encoding primary scalar hair. The properties and characteristics of the solutions at hand are analyzed with varying scalar charge. We observe that when the scalar hair parameter is close to zero or relatively small in comparison to the black hole mass, the solutions closely resemble the Schwarzschild spacetime. As the scalar hair increases, the metric solutions gradually depart from General Relativity. Notably, for a particular relation between mass and scalar hair, the central singularity completely disappears, resulting in the formation of regular black holes or solitons. The scalar field accompanying the solutions is always found to be regular at future or past horizon(s), defining a distinct time direction for each. As a final byproduct of our analysis, we demonstrate the existence of a stealth Schwarschild black hole in Horndeski theory with a non-trivial kinetic term. </blockquote>

<blockquote> We develop a general algorithm that enables the consistent embedding of any four-dimensional static and spherically symmetric geometry into any five-dimensional single-brane braneworld model, characterized by an injective and nonsingular warp factor. Furthermore, we supplement the algorithm by introducing a method that allows one to, in principle, reconstruct 5D field theories that support the aforementioned geometries. This approach is based on a conformal transformation of the metric with the conformal factor being identified with the warp factor of the bulk geometry. The reconstructed theories depend solely on the induced brane geometry, since the warp factor is model-independently represented by a scalar field in the Lagrangian density. As a first application of our reconstruction method, we present for the first time a complete theory that supports the five-dimensional brane-localized extension of the Schwarzschild black hole, for any warp factor. The same method is subsequently utilized to illustrate the process of coherently embedding a de Sitter brane in braneworld models. </blockquote>

<blockquote> In the framework of a simple gravitational theory that contains a scalar field minimally coupled to gravity, we investigate the emergence of analytic black-hole solutions with non-trivial scalar hair of secondary type. Although it is possible for one to obtain asymptotically (A)dS solutions using our setup, in the context of the present work, we are solely interested in asymptotically flat solutions. At first, we study the properties of static and spherically symmetric black-hole solutions emanating from both regular and phantom scalar fields. We find that the regular-scalar-field-induced solutions are solutions describing ultra-compact black holes, while the phantom scalar fields generate ultra-sparse black-hole solutions. The latter are black holes that can be potentially of very low density since, contrary to ultra-compact ones, their horizon radius is always greater than the horizon radius of the corresponding Schwarzschild black hole of the same mass. Then, we generalize the above static solutions to slowly rotating ones and compute their angular velocities explicitly. Finally, the study of the axial perturbations of the derived solutions takes place, in which we show that there is always a region in the parameter space of the free parameters of our theory that allows the existence of both ultra-compact and ultra-sparse black holes. </blockquote>

<blockquote> In this work, we consider a very simple gravitational theory that contains a scalar field with its kinetic and potential terms minimally coupled to gravity, while the scalar field is assumed to have a coulombic form. In the context of this theory, we study an analytic, asymptotically flat, and regular (ultra-compact) black-hole solutions with non-trivial scalar hair of secondary type. At first, we examine the properties of the static and spherically symmetric black-hole solution -- firstly appeared in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1504.08209">1504.08209 [gr-qc]</a> -- and we find that in the causal region of the spacetime the stress-energy tensor, needed to support our solution, satisfies the strong energy conditions. Then, by using the slow-rotating approximation, we generalize the static solution into a slowly rotating one, and we determine explicitly its angular velocity \(\omega(r)\). We also find that the angular velocity of our ultra-compact solution is always larger compared to the angular velocity of the corresponding equally massive slow-rotating Schwarzschild black hole. In addition, we investigate the axial perturbations of the derived solutions by determining the Schrödinger-like equation and the effective potential. We show that there is a region in the parameter space of the free parameters of our theory, which allows for the existence of stable ultra-compact black hole solutions. Specifically, we calculate that the most compact and stable black hole solution is \(0.551\) times smaller than the Schwarzschild one, while it rotates \(2.491\) times faster compared to the slow-rotating Schwarzschild black hole. Finally, we present without going into details the generalization of the derived asymptotically flat solutions to asymptotically (A)dS solutions. </blockquote>

<h2><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.06915"> Analytic and exponentially localized brane-world Reissner-Nordström-AdS solution: a top-down approach </a></h2>

<blockquote> In this work, we construct a five-dimensional spherically-symmetric, charged and asymptotically Anti-de Sitter black hole with its singularity being point-like and strictly localised on our brane. In addition, the induced brane geometry is described by a Reissner-Nordström-(A)dS line-element. We perform a careful classification of the horizons, and demonstrate that all of them are exponentially localised close to the brane thus exhibiting a pancake shape. The bulk gravitational background is everywhere regular, and reduces to an AdS5 spacetime right outside the black-hole event horizon. This geometry is supported by an anisotropic fluid with only two independent components, the energy density \(\rho_E\) and tangential pressure \(p_2\). All energy conditions are respected close to and on our brane, but a local violation takes place within the event horizon regime in the bulk. A tensor-vector-scalar field-theory model is built in an attempt to realise the necessary bulk matter, however, in order to do so, both gauge and scalar degrees of freedom need to turn phantom-like at the bulk boundary. The study of the junction conditions reveals that no additional matter needs to be introduced on the brane for its consistent embedding in the bulk geometry apart from its constant, positive tension. We finally compute the effective gravitational equations on the brane, and demonstrate that the Reissner-Nordström-(A)dS geometry on our brane is caused by the combined effect of the five-dimensional geometry and bulk matter with its charge being in fact a tidal charge. </blockquote>
