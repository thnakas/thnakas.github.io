<blockquote> In this work, we revisit the thermodynamics of black holes endowed with primary and secondary scalar hair in the shift and symmetric subclass of beyond Horndeski gravity. Under a specific fine-tuning of the scalar parameter   in terms of the black hole mass, the singular black-hole solution with primary scalar hair reduces to the regular Bardeen solution featuring secondary scalar hair. We first demonstrate that the traditional thermodynamic approach fails to yield a consistent Smarr formula for both solutions under consideration. To address this issue, we adopt the approach introduced in <a href="https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.132.191401">[Phys Rev Lett. 132 (2024) 19, 191401]</a>, and we derive both the first law of black hole thermodynamics and the Smarr formula, offering a consistent thermodynamic description for scalar-hairy black holes. As an additional outcome, our analysis reveals a connection between the solutions with primary and secondary scalar hair. </blockquote>
